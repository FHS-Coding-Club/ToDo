Here is a step-by-step guide for implementing Firebase Authentication in a web application using only vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This example will cover setting up Firebase, configuring it in your JavaScript, and providing basic sign-in and sign-up features with Firebase's authentication services.

### 1. Set Up Firebase

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2. Create a new project (or use an existing one).
3. Navigate to **Project Settings > General > Your Apps**, and add a new web app.
4. Firebase will give you a configuration snippet, which youâ€™ll add to your HTML.

### 2. Enable Firebase Authentication

1. In the Firebase Console, go to **Authentication > Sign-in method**.
2. Enable **Email/Password** under "Sign-in providers."

### 3. Structure Your HTML

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Firebase Auth Example</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Put all of your html here -->

  <!-- These are the firebase imports. All this is doing is esentially letting you contact firebase and make it so you can enter data in. -->
  <!-- Firebase Scripts -->
  <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.17.1/firebase-app.js"></script>
  <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/9.17.1/firebase-auth.js"></script>

  <!-- Use this tag to link your javascript file-->
  <script src="app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### 5. Configure Firebase and Implement Authentication

Replace the Firebase config object with the credentials provided in your Firebase console.

```javascript
// Firebase Configuration
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
    authDomain: "YOUR_DOMAIN",
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
    messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGE_ID",
    appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
};

firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);

const auth = firebase.auth();
```
Here you are creating a variable that represents your firebase configuration. This is where you will put all of the sensitive information that firebase gives you.
This config variable is responsible for linking your firebase account so you can make changes to it. REMEMBER, NEVER SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH ANYONE!!!!

After you initialize your connection to firebase (firebaseConfig variable), you need to send this config to firebase. This is why we do the:
```javascript
firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
```

This is when you connection to firebase is completed.

The next step is 
### Explanation of Key Parts

- **Sign Up**: `createUserWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password)` creates a new user with the given email and password.
- **Sign In**: `signInWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password)` signs in an existing user.
- **Sign Out**: `signOut(auth)` signs out the current user.
- **onAuthStateChanged**: This listener checks for changes in the authentication state, updating the UI based on whether a user is logged in.

This setup provides a complete basic authentication flow using Firebase in a pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript environment.
